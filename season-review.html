            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div>
              <p>The 2029/30 season was nothing short of electric for Bundesliga fans, with three teams in the spotlight. </p>
              <p>Freiburg started off the season with a bang, winning the German Supercup against Augsburg 5:2. Augsburg was the reigning DFB Cup Champion, but had never won the Bundesliga before, while SC Freiburg had won it twice in succession.</p>
              <p>All three teams battled it out in the Champions League, with Freiburg and Werder Bremen both advancing to the knockout stages. Augsburg, however, failed to make it out of the group stage and were relegated to the Europa League, where they were eventually defeated by Manchester United in a dramatic 6:2 loss.</p>
